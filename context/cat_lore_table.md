# Brehon Cats Lore — Adult Cat Types

Canonical adult cat roles and stats referenced in legacy material. Use this table to keep stat names consistent while prototyping Pangur.

| 2     | 2    | Folum (Herder)         | Field-trained helper; buffs catch and meow.        |

Legacy kittens evolve into Cruibne, Ameonne, or Breoinne; other adults arrive through special events. Pangur uses the same naming where the stats match.
