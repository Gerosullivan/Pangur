# Pangur, Cats, and Early Irish Lore

Pangur in this game draws on _Pangur Ban_, a 9th-century Old Irish poem written by a monk about his white cat. In the poem, the monk compares his quiet work of studying and copying manuscripts to Pangur's work of watching, hunting, and pouncing on mice in the dark corners of the monastery. Man and cat share a small pool of lamplight, each absorbed in their own task, completely content in one another's company.

That sense of focused, companionable work is at the heart of this game's Pangur: a working cat whose joy is in the hunt, but who also shares a kind of partnership with the humans (and players) around them. The monk's script becomes our game rules; Pangur's pounce becomes our catch actions; the small stone cell becomes a playful grid of tiles.

## Cats in Early Irish Life

In early medieval Ireland, cats were not just cute house companions; they were valued workers and status markers. Monasteries, farmsteads, and ringforts all had use for a good mouser: grain needed protecting, food stores needed guarding, and manuscripts needed saving from gnawing teeth and dripping wax. A strong, clever cat could make the difference between a winter's food surviving or being spoiled.

Cats were also one of the few animals that moved freely between the everyday, the scholarly, and the spiritual worlds. You could find them in farmyards, royal households, and monastic scriptoria. They were familiar, practical animals, but they also carried a hint of mystery in the way they slipped between shadow and light, silent until they chose to act.

## Tying This to the Game's Characters

The cats in this game are descended from Pangur Ban and his kin - dedicated mousers with sharp eyes and sharper paws. Their catch/meow stats (like 3/1, 2/2, or 1/3) echo the different roles cats might have played:

- High catch, low meow (like 3/1): a relentless hunter, prized for clearing stores but not particularly gentle or diplomatic. This is the cat the grain-keeper loves but the guests treat with caution.
- Balanced catch and meow (2/2): a reliable companion and worker, equally at home patrolling for mice or curling up near a warm fire, tolerated in both hall and cloister.
- Low catch, high meow (1/3): more guardian and herald than hunter, this cat's value lies in alerting humans, warning other animals away, and keeping the peace in tight quarters.

Mice, for their part, are not just faceless pests. In early Ireland, they threatened the same things people cared deeply about: stored grain, sacred books, and precious cloth. In the game, the mice who evade capture or work together to outsmart Pangur are playing their own survival drama in miniature, echoing the constant tension between hunger, plenty, and protection in Brehon-era life.

## Brehon Law and Cats

Under the Brehon laws - the native legal system of early Ireland - cats were important enough to have explicit legal standing. They were typically divided into roles such as:

- **Mouser**: a working cat whose primary job was hunting vermin.
- **Guard cat**: useful for warning and watching, more like a living alarm.
- **Pet or lap-cat**: valued for companionship and prestige.

Each type of cat had a value (an _eraic_ or honour-price), and there were rules about compensation if a cat was stolen, injured, or killed. There were even colourful details about what a cat owed its household in basic duties: catching mice, not stealing food from the pot, and not scratching without cause. A good mouser - our high catch / lower meow cat - could be worth more than a simple farm animal, while a pampered pet-cat might be tied to the status of its owner.

So when you move Pangur and the other cats around the board, lining up their catch and meow strengths against the scurrying mice, you're playing in the shadow of those old Brehon rules: treating cats not just as cute companions, but as legally recognised workers, guardians, and partners in keeping the household (and the monastery) in order.
