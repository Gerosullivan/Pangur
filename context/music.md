• Here are some styles that could fit the vibe:

- Celtic folk / Celtic fantasy – Fiddles, flutes, harp; feels mythic, old-world, and playful, matches
  “Pangur” roots.
- Acoustic chamber folk – Small ensemble (guitar, strings, clarinet) with warm, intimate textures for
  a cozy barn feel.
- Medieval-inspired game music – Modal melodies, hand percussion, lute-like instruments; hints of
  tavern/BG music without being too heavy.
- Whimsical orchestral – Light strings, woodwinds, celesta; leans into magical/storybook tone of
  clever cats vs mice.
- Dark folk / rustic noir – Slightly eerie drones and plucked strings for the “night patrol” tension.
- Toybox / music-box electronica – Gentle chiptune or music-box sounds mixed with acoustic elements
  for a modern indie-game feel.
- Jazz manouche / gypsy swing–tinged folk – Light swing rhythm, acoustic guitar and violin; can feel
  agile and sneaky like mice and cats.
- Ambient pastoral – Soft pads, distant bells, subtle field sounds (barn creaks, wind) for a calm
  title screen that hints at strategy.

› What about heavy metal? Are there any heavy metal crossovers with a Celtic or North-type genre that
we might be missing?

• The user is looking for a clear, concise list of metal subgenres, like Celtic metal, folk metal, and
Viking metal. I might think about mentioning bands as references, but it's not strictly necessary.
I’ll focus on keeping the list short and straightforward so that it's easy to understand. Alright,
let’s summarize that into an organized format. The key is to highlight the essence of each genre
without overwhelming details.

• Yes, there are a few metal subgenres that sit right in that Celtic / North-space and could inspire an
opening track:

- Celtic Metal – Heavy guitars + traditional Celtic melodies/instruments (whistles, pipes, fiddles).
  Think big, heroic themes but still folky and melodic.
- Folk Metal – Broader category that often blends Northern / pagan themes, acoustic instruments, and
  singable riffs; can be dialed down to a mid‑tempo “battle planning” vibe.
- Viking / Nordic Metal – Epic, chant-like vocals, modal melodies, and pounding rhythms; evokes cold
  nights, old sagas, watchful guardians (fits “cats on patrol”).
- Pagan Metal – Earthy, ritual-ish, lots of atmosphere; could work well if you keep the distortion
  restrained and lean into drums + drones for a title screen.
- Blackgaze / Atmospheric Black Metal with Folk Elements – For a more dreamy, layered wall-of-sound
  with occasional folk lines; you could sample that texture but soften it for the game.

Guess who just crept back today,
Them bright-eyed cats that had been away.
Not much changed, but they’ve got plenty to say—
Man, I still think these whiskers are crazy.
They were askin’ if the mice were around,
How they run, where they could be found.
Told ’em there’s grain stacked downtown—
Now they’re drivin’ all the rodents crazy.

[Chorus]
The cats are back in town, the cats are back in town.
I said, the cats are back in town, the cats are back in
town.

[Verse 2]
You know that tabby used to dance a lot,
Every night on the floor, shakin’ what she’s got.
Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot—
I mean, she was steamin’.
And that time over at Mór’s place,
Well, that mouse popped up, got a paw to the face.
Man, we just fell about the place—
If that mouse don’t wanna know, forget her.

[Chorus]
The cats are back in town, the cats are back in town.
I said, the cats are back in town, the cats are back in
town.

[Bridge]
Spread the word around—guess who’s back in town?
You spread the word around.
Friday night they’ll be dressed to kill
Down by the barn’s old windowsill.
The milk will flow and tails will spill,
And if the cats wanna fight, you better let ’em.

[Verse 3]
That jukebox in the corner, blastin’ out our favorite song,
The nights are gettin’ warmer, it won’t be long—
Won’t be long till the summer comes,
Now that the cats are here again.

[Chorus / Outro]
The cats are back in town, the cats are back in town.
(The cats are back, the cats are back)
The cats are back in town again—
Been prowlin’ down at Mór’s—
The cats are back in town again.
And Pangur Bán, white fang, leads ’em in.
