# Pangur Technical Notes

This prototype intentionally leaves implementation details to the next developer.

## Goals

- Keep scope tightly focused on the core turn loop prototype.
- Favor the simplest approach that satisfies the current design specs.
- Record any trade-offs or new questions back in the context docs as work progresses.
