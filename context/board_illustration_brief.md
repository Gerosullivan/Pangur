# Pangur Game Board - Illustration Design Brief

## Project Overview

Create a square illustration for a physical board game representing a barn interior viewed from directly above (top-down perspective). The board will be used for a turn-based strategy game where cats defend against waves of mice.

## Board Specifications

### Grid Layout

- **Grid Size:** 5×5 squares (25 total cells)
- **Coordinate System:**
  - Columns: A, B, C, D, E (left to right)
  - Rows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (bottom to top)
  - Each cell labeled chess-style (e.g., A1, B3, C5)
- **Orientation:** Row 5 (top) is the barn entrance; Row 1 (bottom) is the back wall

### Board Dimensions

- Square format for physical board game production
- Each cell should be identical in size to accommodate game pieces
- Include subtle grid lines or visual separators between cells (barn floor planks, beam shadows, etc.)

## Setting & Theme

### Overall Aesthetic

- **Setting:** Interior of a rustic barn
- **Perspective:** Straight top-down (bird's eye view)
- **Atmosphere:** Warm, rustic, medieval Celtic/Irish barn aesthetic
- **Lighting:** Natural light filtering in from the entrance (top), creating shadow areas around the perimeter
- **Time:** Daytime with dramatic shadow contrast

### Environmental Details

- Wooden plank flooring throughout
- Exposed wooden beams casting shadows
- Bundles of wheat/hay scattered strategically on shadow tiles
- Rustic barn textures: weathered wood, straw, aged timber
- Small environmental details: cracks in wood, grain dust, straw wisps

## Cell Type Specifications

### 1. Interior Cells (9 cells)

**Locations:** B2, B3, B4, C2, C3, C4, D2, D3, D4

**Visual Characteristics:**

- Lighter wooden floor planks (well-lit barn interior)
- Clean, open floor space suitable for placing game pieces
- Subtle wood grain texture
- Minimal clutter - these are active play areas
- Warm brown/tan color palette
- Some scattered straw or grain dust for texture

**Purpose:** Open play area for cat placement and movement

### 2. Shadow Cells (13 cells)

**Locations:** Entire perimeter EXCEPT B5, C5, D5

- Row 1: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1
- Row 5: A5, E5
- Column A: A2, A3, A4
- Column E: E2, E3, E4

**Visual Characteristics:**

- Darker tones - visually distinct from interior
- Cast in shadow from barn beams, walls, or upper structures
- Contains bundles of wheat/hay stacks as scatter elements
- Darker wooden planks or shadowed floor
- More atmospheric grain dust visible in shadow beams
- Mysterious/defensive aesthetic
- Still clear enough to place game pieces on

**Important Visual Elements:**

- **Wheat Bundles:** Small tied bundles of wheat (🌾) scattered on these tiles
  - 1-3 bundles per shadow cell
  - Positioned to not interfere with piece placement (corners or edges)
  - Golden wheat heads contrasting against dark shadows
  - Various orientations for visual variety

**Purpose:** Strategic upgrade zones for mice; defensive bonus zones for cats

### 3. Entrance Cells (3 cells)

**Locations:** B5, C5, D5

**Visual Characteristics:**

- Three connected entrance archways or door openings at the top of the board
- Bright, well-lit (sunlight streaming in from outside)
- Yellow/gold tones with subtle glow and warm highlights
- Threshold aesthetic - transition from outside to inside
- Perhaps stone or reinforced wooden door frames
- Visual indication of "entry point" (threshold stones, worn floorboards)
- Slightly elevated or distinct flooring material (stone threshold vs wood interior)

**Purpose:** Entrances for incoming mice; special meow deterrence zones

## Outside Board Area

### Incoming Mice Staging Area

**Location:** Above Row 5 (outside the main 5×5 grid, centered above the three entrance cells)

**Visual Characteristics:**

- Exterior barn approach area
- Grass or dirt path leading to the barn entrance
- Should accommodate 6 mouse positions in a horizontal row
- Visual continuation of the barn entrance theme
- Perhaps small rocks, grass tufts, or pathway stones to mark the 6 positions
- Lighter/outdoor color palette
- Clear visual separation from the main game board but cohesive design

**Label:** "Next Wave" or visual indicator for incoming mice queue

**Dimensions:**

- Width: Spans approximately columns B through D
- Height: Additional 1/5th of the board height above Row 5
- Total board becomes slightly rectangular to accommodate this area

## Color Palette

### Primary Colors

- **Teal/Cyan accents:** For highlights, possibly water bucket or tool details
- **Orange/Amber:** Entrance glow, warm light, wheat highlights
- **Rich Brown:** Wood tones, barn structure
- **Coral/Salmon:** Warm accent details
- **Off-White:** Light areas, grain, dust motes
- **Charcoal:** Shadows, dark wood

### Application

- **Interior cells:** Warm browns, lighter tones
- **Shadow cells:** Deep charcoal shadows with darker browns
- **Entrance cells:** Orange/amber glow with off-white highlights (bright, inviting)
- **Wheat bundles:** Golden amber with brown shadows

## Technical Requirements

### Grid Clarity

- Each of the 25 cells must be clearly distinguishable
- Cell boundaries can be subtle but must be visible for piece placement
- Consider using floor planks, beam shadows, or subtle line work to define cells
- Coordinate labels should appear outside the board edges (like chess boards):
  - Column letters (A, B, C, D, E) along the top and/or bottom edge
  - Row numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) along the left and/or right edge
  - No labels within the individual cells themselves

### Piece Placement Zones

- Central area of each cell should be clear of major visual obstacles
- Decorative elements (wheat, shadows, textures) should frame the edges
- Ensure game pieces will be clearly visible when placed on cells

### Visual Hierarchy

1. Entrance cells (B5, C5, D5) - brightest, most eye-catching
2. Interior cells - neutral, clear play space
3. Shadow cells - darker, atmospheric, with wheat details
4. Incoming mice area - distinct but connected

## Atmospheric Details

### Suggested Environmental Elements

- Wooden support beams casting diagonal shadows across cells
- Barn rafters visible in shadow areas
- Scattered straw wisps throughout
- Grain dust motes in light beams (especially near entrances)
- Weathered wood texture - knots, cracks, age marks
- Small tool details in shadows (rake, bucket) - non-intrusive
- Possible cat paw prints in dust on some tiles (subtle easter egg)

### Lighting Direction

- Primary light source from top (Row 5 entrances)
- Creates natural shadow gradient: brightest at entrances, darker toward Row 1
- Shadow cells at perimeter darkest
- Some ambient light in interior (from barn openings)

## Design Constraints

### What to AVOID

- Overcrowding cells with details that interfere with piece placement
- Extremely dark shadows that make pieces hard to see
- Busy patterns that create visual noise
- 3D perspective - must remain pure top-down
- Inconsistent cell sizes
- Overly realistic rendering - stylized illustration preferred

### What to EMPHASIZE

- Clear visual distinction between cell types (interior/shadow/entrance)
- Barn atmosphere and rustic charm
- Functional playability - pieces must be clearly visible
- Celtic/medieval barn aesthetic
- Strategic visual language (shadows = danger/power, entrances = entry, wheat = resource)
